      times because of my volunteer work at iSPACE.

      job refined my teaching skills over my experience of taking over 300 kids
      who have never been on the snow before to their first chairlift ride and
      farther. I learned invaluable leadership and education skills while
      teaching kids my passion.

      <B>Paddlefest App</B> - Created a mobile app (React Native) and the
      supporting Express and MongoDB data modeling for use by participants in
      the fundraiser “Ohio River Paddlefest” (raising funds to help inner-city
      kids get out into nature). Roughly half of all participants (2000)
      downloaded and interacted with the app, viewing a live map of attractions,
      sharing photos, and receiving time-critical notifications for safety and
      logistical issues. We plan to expand the app’s capabilities and marketing
      effort next year after hearing excellent reviews.

      <B>Volunteer Management System</B> - Built a web app (Next.js) and the
      backend (Express) and database (MongoDB) to allow over 130 volunteers to
      register, and allowing Paddlefest leadership to view, manage, edit, and
      check in volunteers before and on the days of the event. The Paddlefest
      VMS led to a more consistent and complete registration process for
      volunteers, and allowed for unprecedented management for the leadership
      team.

      <B>MTS Express</B> - Developed a mobile app and the corresponding backend
      and database for internal use by Myers sales reps to easily and quickly
      order and re-order consumable hardware. In tests, MTS Express tangibly
      improved efficiency by reducing lag time between a customer running out of
      hardware and the replacement order being placed. This immediately reduced
      downtime and improved sales rep workload.
