      <B>Paddlefest App</B> - Created a mobile app (React Native) and the
      supporting Express and MongoDB data modeling for use by participants in
      the fundraiser “Ohio River Paddlefest” (raising funds to help inner-city
      kids get out into nature). Roughly half of all participants (2000)
      downloaded and interacted with the app, viewing a live map of attractions,
      sharing photos, and receiving time-critical notifications for safety and
      logistical issues. We plan to expand the app’s capabilities and marketing
      effort next year after hearing excellent reviews.

      <B>Volunteer Management System</B> - Built a web app (Next.js) and the
      backend (Express) and database (MongoDB) to allow over 130 volunteers to
      register, and allowing Paddlefest leadership to view, manage, edit, and
      check in volunteers before and on the days of the event. The Paddlefest
      VMS led to a more consistent and complete registration process for
      volunteers, and allowed for unprecedented management for the leadership
      team.

      <B>Volunteer Coordinator</B> - Served as the volunteer coordinator for

      providing them with information, serving as a liason between volunteers
      and leadership, and ensuring that our guests had a great experience by
      providing an excellent volunteer experience.

      <B>MTS Express</B> - Developed a mobile app and the corresponding backend
      and database for internal use by Myers sales reps to easily and quickly
      order and re-order consumable hardware. In tests, MTS Express tangibly
      improved efficiency by reducing lag time between a customer running out of
      hardware and the replacement order being placed. This immediately reduced
      downtime and improved sales rep workload.

      sales reps and allowed them to more easily view and analyze their sales
      data. It features auth, role-based access control, high-performance huge
      data tables (with conditional formatting), and suite of admin tools.
